```javascript
// pages/index.js
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <Image src="/images/my-image.jpg" alt="My Image" width={500} height={300} />
    </div>
  );
}

// Make sure the image is in the correct folder and the path in the image tag is correct.
```
The solution ensures correct handling of static assets by using the `next/image` component with appropriate handling of paths, or by making sure all paths are correctly set in your application configuration. This guarantees consistency between the server-side and client-side rendering processes, thus preventing hydration mismatches.
